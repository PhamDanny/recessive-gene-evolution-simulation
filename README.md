# recessive-gene-evolution-simulation
A simulation to demonstrate how a recessive gene can become more common than the dominant gene in a natural environment.

Instructions: Enter the requested data.
Species Name: The name of the species being tested.
Initial Population: The population that the tested species starts with.
Maximum Population: The highest population that the environment can sustain.
Survival Chance: The chance that any given animal survives until the next generation (number from 1-100).
Trait bonus: How much more likely a holder of the tested recessive gene is to survive until the next generation than a holder of the dominant gene (number from 1-100).
